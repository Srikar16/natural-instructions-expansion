Now, more than five years after Savita Halappanavar lost her life after a miscarriage in a Galway hospital, her father has urged voters to repeal the clause of the constitution that he says contributed to her death, and legalise abortion.\n\n“I hope the people of Ireland remember my daughter Savita on the day of the referendum, and that what happened to her won’t happen to any other family,” Andanappa Yalagi told the Guardian by phone from his home in Karnataka, in south-west India. He said his daughter’s death at the age of 31 had devastated the family. “It’s still very emotional after five years. I think about her every day. She didn’t get the medical treatment she needed because of the eighth amendment. They must change the law. Savita Halappanavar's parents call for 'yes' vote in Irish abortion referendum – video\n01:13\nSavita Halappanavar's parents call for 'yes' vote in Irish abortion referendum – video\nHalappanavar’s husband, Praveen, has not spoken publicly about her death since an out-of-court settlement was agreed shortly before a medical negligence case was due to open at Ireland’s high court in 2016.\n\nBut in the weeks after his wife’s death, he said: “It was the end of the world. She wanted to live, have babies … I still can’t believe she’s not with us. We just can’t believe that in the 21st century, something like this would happen.”\n\nProtestors before Repeal the 8th mural outside Dublin’s Project Arts centre, which was painted over at the behest of the Irish charities regulator.\n‘I had no real interest in politics, until this’ – Ireland’s accidental abortion activists\nRead more\nThe family believe that at the centre of their tragedy was a clause in Ireland’s constitution that gives protection to an unborn child, which has resulted in abortion being illegal in almost all circumstances. Voters will decide whether to repeal or retain this clause, known as the eighth amendment, in Friday’s referendum.\n\nOn Tuesday the chair of an official investigation into Halappanavar’s death, Prof Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, called on voters to back the repeal of the clause, saying it tied doctors’ hands.\n\nHalappanavar, a dentist from Karnataka, was 17 weeks pregnant with her first child when she sought advice at University Hospital Galway for intense back pain on Sunday 21 October 2012.\n\nQuick Guide\nThe Irish abortion referendum\nShow\nWithin hours, medical staff concluded that a miscarriage was inevitable, although a foetal heartbeat could be heard. The plan was to allow the pregnancy to end naturally.\n\nAfter being told of the risk of infection following the rupture of the foetal membranes, the Halappanavars asked whether it was possible to medically induce the miscarriage. A consultant later recalled saying: “Under Irish law, if there’s no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, our hands are tied as long there’s a foetal heart[beat].” No intervention took place.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday 24 October, the medical team diagnosed infection and, later, septic shock. A plan was made, but not enacted, to give Halappanavar a drug to induce an abortion. She spontaneously miscarried mid-afternoon and was subsequently admitted to intensive care, where she died in the early hours of Sunday 28 October, almost a week after being admitted to hospital.\n\nIn media interviews in the following weeks, Praveen Halappanavar said he and his wife had repeatedly asked for the pregnancy to be terminated after her admission to hospital, but they had been told “this is a Catholic country”.\n\nA pro-choice mural in Dublin featuring Savita Halappanavar, urging a yes vote in the referendum.\nA pro-choice mural in Dublin featuring Savita Halappanavar, urging a yes vote in the referendum. Photograph: Niall Carson/PA\nWhen the news of Halappanavar’s death broke, thousands of people took part in candlelit vigils and protests across Ireland, calling for changes to allow women to have access to legal abortions. Campaigners for reform said she was a tragic example of how the Irish state failed to protect its citizens. Amnesty International said the law left women in Ireland “in a very vulnerable position”.\n\nAnti-abortion campaigners claimed the case was being exploited and distorted by those with an agenda to liberalise Ireland’s stringent laws. The Catholic bishops of Ireland said a woman and her unborn child had an equal right to life.\n\nSavita Halappanavar\nIreland's shame: the death of Savita Halappanavar – The Story podcast\nRead more\nIn 2013 a five-day inquest heard evidence and took written statements from dozens of hospital staff. Several said Halappanavar probably would have survived if it had been legally possible to terminate the pregnancy earlier. The jury returned a unanimous verdict of medical misadventure.\n\nAn investigation commissioned by the Health Service Executive, chaired by Arulkumaran, later found there had been an “over-emphasis on the need not to intervene until the foetal heart had stopped”, as well as poor patient monitoring and risk assessment. It strongly recommended that the Irish parliament consider changing the law, and “any necessary constitutional change”.\n\nA second investigation, carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority, made no mention of the law or constitution but said the hospital had failed to properly monitor Halappanavar and act when her condition deteriorated.\n\nDette McLouglin, 60, who took part in protests in 2012 and is now campaigning in Galway for a yes vote to repeal the amendment, said Halappanavar’s death was “a shock to Ireland … The shock turned to anger. There was a sea change in attitudes. The topic had been taboo, it couldn’t be talked about it, but suddenly people were coming out on the streets in their thousands.”\n\nNow the “Savita issue” is being raised on doorsteps in Galway, according to McLoughlin. “People are saying: what happened to that poor woman we don’t want to happen to our children or grandchildren.”\n\nNevertheless, she expects the outcome of the referendum to be “down to the wire. We see very enthusiastic yes supporters and a lot of emphatic nos. It’s all down to the maybes.” It is estimated that one in five voters are undecided.\n\nSavita Halappanavar’s parents in their video appeal to Ireland.\nSavita Halappanavar’s parents in their video appeal to Ireland.

      {"input": "DUBLIN – Ireland's referendum Friday represented more than a vote on whether to end the country's strict abortion ban. It was a battle for the very soul of a traditionally conservative Roman Catholic nation that has seen a wave of liberalization in recent years.\n\nAn Irish Times exit poll released Friday night projected a landslide victory for those who want to loosen abortion laws, but official results are not expected until Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe country's leaders support a \"yes,\" an outcome that would repeal a 1983 constitutional amendment requiring authorities to treat a fetus and its mother as equals under the law. They called it a once-in-a-generation opportunity to liberalize some of Europe's strictest abortion rules.\n\n\nVoters went to the polls after a campaign that aroused deep emotions on both sides. For advocates of repeal, a \"yes\" vote would be a landmark in Irish women's fight for equality and the right to control their own bodies. For opponents, it would be a betrayal of Ireland's commitment to protect the unborn.\n\nThe vote also is a key indicator of Ireland's trajectory, three years after the country voted to allow same-sex marriages and a year after its first openly gay prime minister took office.\n\nThe newspaper exit poll indicated overwhelming support for change. The survey by pollster Ipsos-MRBI says 68 percent of voters backed repeal of the ban and 32 percent opposed it. The pollster says it interviewed some 4,000 people and the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. The poll is only a prediction.\n\nTheresa Sweeney, a repeal supporter, was one of the first to arrive at a church polling station in Dublin.\n\n\"I feel like I've waited all of my adult life to have a say on this,\" she said.\n\nEmma Leahy said her \"yes\" vote comes from her firm belief that everyone should be able to make their own choice when it comes to abortion.\n\n\"For Ireland, it's hope for the future,\" she said of the referendum. \"Whether you agree or disagree, it shouldn't be the government or anyone else making that decision.\"\n\n\nVera Rooney voted against repeal.\n\n\"It is a hard decision but I just feel I don't have the right to take life,\" she said. \"I think life is sacred and for that reason I had to vote no.\"\n\nThe referendum will decide whether the eighth amendment of the constitution is repealed or stays in place.\n\nThe amendment requires authorities to equally protect the right to life of a mother and that of a fetus, from the moment of conception. That effectively bans all abortions in Ireland, except in cases when the woman's life is at risk. Having an illegal abortion is punishable by up to 14 years in prison, and several thousand Irish women travel each year to get abortions in neighboring Britain.\n\nIf citizens vote in favor of repeal, new abortion laws will then be discussed in parliament. The government proposes that terminations be allowed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Later abortions would be allowed in special cases.\n\nPrime Minister Leo Varadkar, a doctor, voted in favor of repeal.\n\n\"Not taking anything for granted of course, but quietly confident,\" he said, adding that the upside of a sunny day in Ireland is that people come out to vote.\n\n\nThousands of Irish people abroad travelled home to take part in the historic referendum, and supporters of repeal gathered at Dublin Airport to give arrivals an ecstatic welcome.\n\nSome activists held a placard reading \"Thank you for making the journey so other women don't have to\" — a reference to the way Irish women seeking abortions have had to leave the country to obtain them.\n\nTara Flynn, who 11 years ago flew to the Netherlands for an abortion, said she planned to vote \"yes\" to make sure future generations of women don't endure what she did, with feelings of isolation and shame.\n\nShe said her vote would be one for solidarity and compassion, \"a vote to say, I don't send you away anymore.\"\n\nCampaigning was not allowed Friday, but Dublin was still filled with signs and banners urging citizens to vote \"yes\" or \"no.\" Many of the anti-abortion signs showed photographs of fetuses.\n\nVoting has already taken place on Ireland's remote islands so that paper ballots can be taken to the mainland and counted in time.\n\nLetters to the editor published Friday in the Irish Independent newspaper contained several emotional arguments urging voters to reject the repeal movement.\n\n\n\"If we vote 'yes' every unborn, wanted and unwanted, will have zero rights,\" wrote Frances Kelleher, from Killarney. \"I do not believe the smart people of Ireland want this unrestricted, abortion-on-demand bill.",

        "input": "BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil’s government weighed pushing for a management overhaul at iron ore miner Vale SA on Monday as grief over the hundreds feared killed by a dam burst turned into anger, with prosecutors, politicians and victims’ families calling for punishment.\n\n\nBy Monday night, firefighters in the state of Minas Gerais had confirmed that 65 people were killed by Friday’s disaster, when a burst tailings dam sent a torrent of sludge into the miner’s offices and the town of Brumadinho.\n\nThere were still 279 people unaccounted for, and officials said it was unlikely that any would be found alive.\n\nBrazil’s acting president, Hamilton Mourao, told reporters a government task force on the disaster response is looking at whether it could or should change Vale’s top management.\n\nPublic-sector pension funds hold several seats on the board of the mining company, and the government holds a “golden share” giving it power over strategic decisions.\n\n“The question of Vale’s management is being studied by the crisis group,” said Mourao, who is serving as acting president for some 48 hours while President Jair Bolsonaro recovers from surgery. “I’m not sure if the group could make that recommendation.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nShares of Vale, the world’s largest iron ore and nickel producer, plummeted 24.5 percent on Monday in Sao Paulo, erasing nearly $19 billion in market capitalization. A U.S. law firm filed a shareholder class action lawsuit against the company in New York, seeking to recover investment losses.\n\nIgor Lima, a fund manager at Galt Capital in Rio, said the severe threats from the government and prosecutors drove the shares even lower than many analysts had estimated.\n\n“This reaction has brought quite a lot of uncertainty about the size of the financial punishment Vale will have to handle”, he said.\n\nSenator Renan Calheiros, who is in the thick of a Senate leadership race, on Twitter called for Vale’s top management to be removed urgently “out of respect for the victims ... and to avoid any destruction of evidence.”\n\nOne of Vale’s lawyers, Sergio Bermudes, told newspaper Folha de S. Paulo that management should not leave the company and said that Calheiros was trying to profit politically from the tragedy.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nVale to maintain royalties payment to Brumadinho after disaster: CFO\nVale stock plunges after Brazil disaster; $19 billion in market value lost\n\nSee more stories\n\nVale’s senior executives have apologized for the disaster but have not accepted responsibility, saying the installations met the highest industry standards.\n\nBrazil’s top prosecutor, Raquel Dodge, said the company should be held strongly responsible and criminally prosecuted. Executives could also be personally held responsible, she said.\n\nREPEATED FAILURES\nThe disaster at the Corrego do Feijao mine occurred less than four years after a dam collapsed at a nearby mine run by Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture by Vale and BHP Billiton, killing 19 and dumping toxic sludge in a major river.\n\nWhile the 2015 Samarco disaster unleashed about five times more mining waste, Friday’s dam break was far deadlier as the wall of mud hit Vale’s local offices, including a crowded cafeteria, and tore through a populated area downhill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n“The cafeteria was in a risky area,” Renato Simao de Oliveiras, 32, said while searching for his twin brother, a Vale employee, at an emergency response station. “Just to save money, even if it meant losing the little guy. ... These businessmen, they only think about themselves.”\n\nAs search efforts continued on Monday, firefighters laid down wood planks to cross a sea of sludge that is hundreds of meters wide in places, to reach a bus in search of bodies inside. Villagers discovered the bus as they tried to rescue a nearby cow stuck in the mud.\n\nLongtime resident Ademir Rogerio cried as he surveyed the mud where Vale’s facilities once stood on the edge of town.\n\n“The world is over for us,” he said. “Vale is the top mining company in the world. If this could happen here, imagine what would happen if it were a smaller miner.”\n\nNestor José de Mury said he lost his nephew and coworkers in the mud. “I’ve never seen anything like it, it killed everyone,” he said.\n\n\nSlideshow ( 15 images )\nVale Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani told journalists on Monday evening that, despite interrupting operations in Brumadinho, the company would continue royalty payments to the municipality. He said Vale royalties made up about 60 percent of the town’s 140 million reais in revenue last year.\n\nSiani said a donation of 100,000 reais will be made to each family that lost a relative in the disaster and said Vale would step up investments in dam safety.\n\nSAFETY DEBATE\nThe board of Vale, which has raised its dividends over the last year, suspended all shareholder payouts and executive bonuses late on Sunday, as the disaster put its corporate strategy under scrutiny.\n\nSince the disaster, courts have order a freeze on 11.8 billion reais of Vale’s assets to cover damages. State and federal authorities have slapped it with 349 million reais of administrative fines.\n\n\nSlideshow ( 15 images )\nGerman insurer Allianz SE may have to cover some of the costs of the dam collapse, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\n“I’m not a mining technician. I followed the technicians’ advice and you see what happened. It didn’t work,” Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman said in a TV interview. “We are 100 percent within all the standards, and that didn’t do it.”\n\nMany wondered if the state of Minas Gerais, named for the mining industry that has shaped its landscape for centuries, should have higher standards.\n\n“There are safe ways of mining,” said Joao Vitor Xavier, head of the mining and energy commission in the state assembly. “It’s just that it diminishes profit margins, so they prefer to do things the cheaper way – and put lives at risk.”\n\nReaction to the disaster could threaten the plans of Brazil’s newly inaugurated president to relax restrictions on the mining industry, including proposals to open up indigenous reservations and large swaths of the Amazon jungle for mining.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nEnvironment Minister Ricardo Salles said in a TV interview on Monday that Brazil should create new regulation for mining dams, replacing wet tailings dams with dry mining methods.\n\nMines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque proposed in a Sunday newspaper interview that the law be changed to assign responsibility in cases such as Brumadinho to the people responsible for certifying the safety of mining dams.\n\n“Current law does not prevent disasters like the one we saw on Brumadinho,” he said. “The model for verifying the state of mining dams will have to be reconsidered. The model isn’t good.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer, Maria Carolina Marcello, Ricardo Brito and Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Leslie Adler",

Those who live nearby reported hearing a loud noise at the time of the collapse.\n\nPresentational grey line\nMany questions remain\nBy David Shukman, BBC science editor in Brumadinho\n\nAt the edge of the disaster zone, where the dangerous red sludge reached its height, we spotted a man kneeling in the dirt, praying over a Bible placed on the ground in front of him.\n\nLocal businessman Leandro Gil was mourning a family now missing in the mud. No sooner had we started to talk than his eyes filled with tears and he turned to my translator with a request - could he have a hug from the reporter who had made the long trek from England to report on this disaster?\n\nStunned by the tragedy, Leandro was full of questions many are asking here, some more angrily than others. How could our world have become so lacking in compassion? How could values have eroded so far that someone - working on the dam - just thought about himself?\n\nWhoever that was, Leandro said, he didn't protect the dam properly. This is a region of pretty hills and iron-rich geology, where thousands depend on the mines. But many are grieving and wondering if the mining companies and the authorities are watching the next vulnerable dam and doing enough to avoid another catastrophe.\n\nPresentational grey line\nDozens of trapped people, many of them covered in mud, had to be evacuated by helicopter as roads were destroyed.\n\nVale says the cause of the collapse is being investigated and that instruments used to measure dam pressure had not detected any problems.\n\nThe company's president, Fabio Schvartsman, said the accident may have occurred too quickly for any alarm to be activated.\n\nPresentational white space\nA state official told Reuters that all evidence suggested the dam burst was caused by liquefaction - a process by which a solid material such as sand loses strength and stiffness and turns to liquid.\n\nThe BBC's Julia Carneiro says liquefaction was the cause of a separate dam collapse three years ago in Mariana, owned by a Vale subsidiary. Both structures are upstream dams, mostly built with dried mining waste or tailings, a mixture of sand and clay-like mud.\n\nAs hopes of finding anyone alive dwindle, thoughts are now turning to how to deal with the 12 million cubic metres of mud that was released.\n\nThe UN's Special Rapporteur on Toxics, Baskut Tuncak, has called for an inquiry into the toxicity of the waste and urged the Brazilian government to take immediate precautionary measures.",

If the electorate repeals the eighth it would allow for the government to legislate on terminations.\n\nWhat is the eighth amendment?\n\nAbortion was already illegal in Ireland under the Offences against the Person Act of 1861. In 1983, pro-life activists who feared that this could be changed set about securing protection for the unborn in the constitution, by lobbying the government for a referendum.\n\n\n\nA vote was then held on 7 September 1983 which proposed adding an eighth amendment to the constitution of Ireland. It read as follows:\n\n“The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.”\n\nThe referendum was passed, with 66.9 per cent voting Yes, and 33.1 per cent voting No. The turnout was 53 per cent, amounting to around 1.2 million people. Only five constituencies returned No votes, including four in Dublin.\n\nThis effectively gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, all but banning abortion.\n\n“Case X” and the referendums of 1992 and 2002\n\nIn 1992, “Case X” marked a landmark moment in Ireland’s abortion journey. A 14-year-old girl who became pregnant as a result of rape claimed to be suicidal after she was prevented from travelling to Britain for an abortion. The Supreme Court then decided that the girl had the right to an abortion, with the eighth amendment considered, since there was a “real and substantial risk” to her life – and that of the unborn.\n\nThis sparked great debate around the country, and highlighted problems with the eighth amendment. As a result, three referendums were held simultaneously on the same day in November 1992.\n\nRecommended\nAbortion law in Ireland might soon be changed\nAbortion law in Ireland might soon be changed\nThe 12th amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for an abortion, but was defeated. The 13th and 14th amendments acknowledged that women could travel abroad for terminations, and that information about services in other countries could be made available to them. These were both passed and added to the constitution, effectively acknowledging that despite the ban, many women simply went abroad for terminations.\n\n\nIn 2002, another referendum again attempted to remove suicide as grounds for an abortion in Ireland, but it was rejected, with 50.42 per cent voting No.\n\nMost watched\nThe road to reform\n\nIn 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention on Human Rights, citing the lack of clarity available to women on what circumstances would constitute grounds for a legal abortion.\n\n\nIn 2012, the case of Savita Halappanavar caused shock waves around Ireland and the world after the dentist died in a Galway hospital due to complications from a septic miscarriage, which took days to unfold. Despite her requests during the ordeal, she was denied an abortion.\n\nFinally, in 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed into law, defining the circumstances in which abortion could be carried out legally. This consisted of three scenarios: risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency, or risk of loss of life from suicide.\n\nWhat happens if Ireland repeals the eighth?\n\nIreland still has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, and the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment – which effectively has its roots as far back as 1983 – has picked up speed in recent years, buoyed by a new generation of feminists, a growing appreciation of the wider need for equality and rights, and the success of the same sex marriage referendum in 2015.\n\nOn 25 May, Ireland has a historic opportunity to change the country’s abortion law. Voters will be asked if they want to repeal the eighth amendment, and allow the government to legislate on terminations.\n\nIf Ireland votes Yes, the existing article of the constitution which was inserted in 1983 – and the 1992 additions – will be replaced with this text:\n\n“Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.”\n\nFor its part, the government is proposing that it would legislate to permit abortion in cases where there is a risk to the life of the woman, a medical emergency or a fatal foetal abnormality, or up to 12 weeks without justification.\n\nThe two main parties of Ireland, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, are not taking official positions on the referendum, but politicians are permitted to campaign on a personal basis, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who supports a Yes vote. Both Sinn Fein and the Labour party are supporting Yes as party policy.\n\nIf Ireland votes No, the eighth amendment will remain in place.",

The result was a two-thirds majority: 66.4% yes to 33.6% no.\n\nAdvertisement\nDraft legislation was set out before Friday’s vote and will now be formalised over the coming weeks, to be tabled in the Dáil, Ireland’s parliament, in the autumn. Speaking on Saturday, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said he hoped the law would be changed before the end of the year.\n\nThe change is not expected to face significant hurdles in parliament, with members who opposed repeal acknowledging the overwhelming nature of the result.\n\nOn Saturday’s announcement of the historic result at Dublin Castle, Harris told supporters of repeal: “Under the eighth amendment we used to say to women in crisis: take the boat or take the plane. Today we say, take our hand.”\n\nVaradkar said Saturday would be remembered as the day Ireland “embraced our responsibilities as citizens and as a country … The day Ireland stepped out from under the last of our shadows and into the light. The day we came of age as a country. The day we took our place among the nations of the world.”\n\nSaturday’s triumph for abortion reformers occurred only months before Pope Francis visits the country – the first since John Paul II’s tour of Ireland in 1979.\n\nOrla O’Connor, the co-director of the Together for Yes campaign, said it was “a monumental day for women in Ireland”, calling the result “a rejection of an Ireland that treats women as second-class citizens”.\n\n\nIreland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, stressed that the outcome proved this was “not Dublin versus the rest … not a rural-urban division”.\n\nOne of the first constituencies to declare a result – Dublin Central – had nearly 77% voting yes. Yet even in traditionally conservative Roscommon/East Galway the first tallies from the count showed 57% for yes and 43% for no. Other rural constituencies such as Carlow/Kilkenny also voted 63.5% in favour of change.\n\nIn the last major referendum, the vote to legalise same-sex marriage three years ago, Roscommon was the only area to vote no.\n\nThis time, the only constituency to return a majority of no votes was Donegal, where 51.87% opposed repeal, while 48.13% backed it.\n\nThe overall turnout of Friday’s abortion referendum, at 64.51%, exceeded the 60.5% that voted in the 2015 marriage plebiscite.\n\nVictory for the yes side means that the only part of the United Kingdom and Ireland where abortion remains banned in almost all circumstances is Northern Ireland.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, both Amnesty International and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, called for Northern Ireland’s near-total ban on abortion to be lifted.\n\nAmnesty’s Grainne Teggart said women in Northern Ireland were “still prosecuted by a Victoria-era abortion ban”.\n\nTeggart said the British government could no longer turn a blind eye to the plight of Northern Irish women who were forced to travel across the Irish Sea for abortions.",

An RTE/Behaviour & Attitudes survey put the margin at 69 percent to 31 percent.\n\nIf confirmed, the outcome will be the latest milestone on a path of change for a country which only legalised divorce by a razor thin majority in 1995 before becoming the first in the world to adopt gay marriage by popular vote three years ago.\n\n“It’s looking like we will make history tomorrow,” Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who was in favour of change, said on Twitter.\n\nVote-counting begins at 0800 GMT on Saturday, with the first indication of results expected mid-morning.\n\nVoters were asked if they wish to scrap a 1983 amendment to the constitution that gives an unborn child and its mother equal rights to life. The consequent prohibition on abortion was partly lifted in 2013 for cases where the mother’s life is in danger.\n\nPhotographs on Twitter showed campaigners hugging and in tears at the Together4yes umbrella group’s headquarters shortly after the first exit poll was published.\n\nJustice Minister Charlie Flanagan called it “another big step out of our dark past.” Minister for Children Katherine Zappone, an early advocate for holding the referendum, said an “emotional, historic day” lay ahead.\n\nVaradkar called the vote a once-in-a-generation chance and voters responded with national broadcaster RTE reporting that turnout could be one of the highest for a referendum, potentially topping the 61 percent who backed gay marriage by a large margin.\n\nNo social issue has divided Ireland’s 4.8 million people as sharply as abortion, which was pushed up the political agenda by the death in 2012 of a 31-year-old Indian immigrant from a septic miscarriage after she was refused a termination.\n\nYet the Irish Times exit poll showed overwhelming majorities in all age groups under 65 voted for change, including almost nine in every 10 voters under the age of 24.\n\nThe RTE poll suggested the highest “Yes” vote was in Dublin, where 80 percent were in favour, but there was no sharp urban/rural divide as in previous referendums on the subject, with 63 percent of people living in areas with a population under 1,500 backing the proposals.\n\n“So many women have travelled across to England to take care of their family and healthcare needs and I think it’s a disgrace and it needs to change,” said “Yes” voter Sophie O’Gara, 28, referring to women who travel to Britain for abortions.\n\nFierce campaign\n\nThe fiercely contested vote divided political parties, saw the once-mighty church take a back seat, and became a test case for how global internet giants deal with social media advertising in political campaigns.\n\nUnlike in 1983, when religion was front and centre and abortion was a taboo subject for most, the campaign was defined by women on both sides publicly describing their personal experiences of terminations.\n\n“Yes” campaigners argued that with over 3,000 women travelling to Britain each year for terminations a right enshrined in a 1992 referendum and others ordering pills illegally online, abortion is already a reality in Ireland.\n\nAlthough not on the ballot paper, the “No” camp sought to seize on government plans to allow abortions with no restriction up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy if the referendum is carried, calling it a step too far for most voters.\n\nSome “Yes” politicians were already calling on the government to pass the legislation without delay following the publication of the exit polls.\n\nThe Irish government’s push to liberalise the laws is in contrast to the United States, where abortion has long been legal, but President Donald Trump backs stripping federal funding from women’s health care clinics that offer abortions.\n\nHome to vote\n\nDaily newsletter\nReceive essential international news every morning\n\nSubscribe\nVideos shared on social media showed scores of voters arriving home at Irish airports from abroad.

        "input": "Tunisians marked the seventh anniversary of the Arab Spring uprising with a peaceful rally against austerity measures on Sunday, capping a week of sometimes violent protests triggered by tax and price hikes.\n\nADVERTISING\nThe North African country is seen as having enjoyed a relatively smooth democratic transition since the January 14, 2011 toppling of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after 23 years in power. Seven years later, however, anger over rising prices and the country’s persistent economic problems is again boiling over.\n\nDesigned to revive the economy while meeting Tunisia's agreements with international donors, the government's new financial bill came into effect on January 1. Yet after a week of fierce protests, critics say the new measures are only exacerbating the problem.\n\nFRANCE 24 spoke with Max Gallien, a PhD candidate and researcher on the political economy of North Africa at the London School of Economics (LSE), about the economic situation in Tunisia, and how this has informed the current crisis.\n\nFRANCE 24: Rising living costs are seen as the major trigger of the protests in Tunisia; who or what is to blame for the increase?\n\nMax Gallien: It is important to distinguish between this new spike that we are seeing since January 1 – which is partly due to the new measures in the financial law, and also due partly to the response of shops and merchants to increases in taxes and tariffs – and the backdrop of rising inflation in Tunisia over the last few years, connected to the continuous depreciation of the dinar. Tunisia imports a significant amount of food, so this is quite directly influenced by the currency crisis.\n\nWho is to blame? It is a combination of larger macro-economic factors that will be a reality for the foreseeable future, but also government policy that has been fixated on deficit reduction.\n\nTunisians give government yellow card at austerity protests\n\nThe social costs these reforms will have on people across the country has not been on the government’s radar. That is the case, for example, when we look at rising prices and compare them to the relatively limited rise in the minimum wage over the last couple of years.\n\nThe other major factor are international financial institutions, particularly the IMF [International Monetary Fund], which has been pushing towards austerity programs and devaluation of the dinar.\n\nYou mentioned the government’s financial bill, that passed controversially last year and came into effect on January 1 – what has this meant to the average Tunisian?\n\nThere are subtle differences between what is in the bill, and the actual results.\n\nFirst, there have been VAT increases across three tax brackets – all of them increasing by 1%. There are also individual increases for specific businesses, like car dealerships and large scale commercial platforms, as well as a relatively small decrease in subsidies.\n\nBut the main thing this has meant for Tunisians is that, having already faced steady increases in the price of things like gas, electricity and food in recent years, they have once again seen another spike on January 1. Tunisians report that shops are now 10-15% more expensive than they were even just a few weeks ago.\n\nThe IMF approved a 2.9-billion-dollar loan for Tunisia in 2016, but froze the second installment last year until Tunis demonstrates its commitment to austerity. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed’s response – by pushing through a reform budget – has triggered these protests. Is the government stuck between a rock and a hard place, and is there a way out?\n\nIt is a difficult question, as it is hard to unpin how much of this is IMF pressure and how much these reforms are due to the ideological position of this government – and whether this would remain unchanged if the IMF were to back off.\n\nThe government likes to present itself as being stuck between strong unions on the one hand, calling for one thing, and international financial actors calling for another.\n\nTo formulate any immediate way forward is difficult, though if the international community and international financial institutions were to take a different approach to Tunisia it would be of extreme importance to any step out of the current predicament.\n\nWhat would this change to the international community’s approach look like?\n\nThe first thing would be to think of the social impact of the reforms we are seeing now. This impact should not be suprising to anyone who has monitored the Tunisian economy, and it should have disqualified these reforms before they happened.\n\nSo something to change would be to keep an eye on the social impact of any of these reforms, without just looking at deficit reduction, and then also to give the Tunisian government more breathing space with international lenders.\n\nTunisia’s social affairs minister, Mohamed Trabelsi, announced on Saturday certain concessions and welfare increases. Will these be enough to placate those protesting?\n\nThe government has a serious credibility issue, meaning this tactic may well prove ineffective. People have grown sceptical of government promises. I am personally sceptical of whether the government’s promises [to increase monthly aid and improve access to medical care and housing for families in need – editor's note] will be enough to change the situation and thereby ease tensions.\n\nThey are short-term fixes for a much bigger problem.\n\nWhat steps should the government take to change its economic policy and address the situation?\n\nIf we look at the way the Tunisian government after 2011 has addressed the legacies of economic authoritarianism in the country, there has been a focus on addressing the legacy of state overreach – of corruption, of state involvement with certain business families.\n\nBut there has been very little thinking about the effects of state neglect, where the state previously fell short, for example in improving infrastructure in interior regions [as opposed to wealthier coastal areas – editor’s note], or creating access to a labour market that goes beyond public sector hiring.\n\nInstead, the focus has been on ‘levelling the playing field’. Simply put, this just won’t work for everybody, because the playing field has been uneven for so long. You have to help people up first.\n\nit\nFRANCE 24's Christopher Moore reports from Tunis on Sunday's protests\n\nThere are people who have been shut out of the labour market entirely, living in regions with poor infrastructure where no private investment will go without incentives. Meanwhile the education system in some areas appears to have been purposefully allowed to deteriorate.\n\nThere need to be specific economic interventions in these regions, and these things are going to be costly and they will have to go through the state.\n\nThese things do not work well with the current ideology that dominates Tunisian economic policy, but they are absolutely essential.\n\nYou mentioned ‘levelling the playing field’. The idea was recently thrown into question by a controversial law granting amnesty to businessmen accused of corruption before the 2011 revolution. The government said it was economically necessary: is this the case?\n\nThe economic rationale behind the law has always been questionable to say the least.\n\nThe idea that it will help investment has been used to justify just about anything. It has not been questioned as it should have been. In Tunisian media self-declared ‘economists’ have given specific GDP growth figures claiming the law would lead to a 1.2% increase. This is absolutely preposterous. There is no economic model in the world where pardoning 2,000 corrupt bureaucrats leads to 1.2% growth.\n\nIt is this kind of pseudo-economic language that has been used to justify things that have nothing to do with investment in Tunisia.\n\nDoes Tunisia simply need more time to address these pressing economic issues?\n\nDaily newsletter\nReceive essential international news every morning\n\nSubscribe\nTime is a factor of course. Yet I don’t think it’s an issue of walking too slowly, but in the right direction. There needs to be a different approach by the government towards the economy, but as I mentioned before it is important to stress the role of the international community in terms of its priorities for Tunisia.\n\nIf you look at how the international community was able to do bring money to address the security situation in the country, the same approach is needed for the economic disparities in Tunisia: they threaten its stability in the same way.\n\nFinally, following these reforms the government has assured 2018 would be the last hard year for Tunisia – is this feasible, or just empty rhetoric?\n\nIt is utterly unfeasible. If we look at the debt repayment structure that Tunisia is facing, and the larger macro-economic trends with respect to inflation, currency and wages, the idea that if things continue as they are the situation will improve is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nYou have to ask – who is really causing harm to the economy? If you push reforms to the point where people are so destitute they believe the only way to engage is to protest, then your reforms are not sustainable. […] Blaming protestors for prolonging the crisis is the same as blaming the ‘canary in the coalmine’.",

        "input": "Five days after a dam collapse at a Brazilian mine, residents were mourning Wednesday the nearly 360 people killed and missing -- as well the river they live alongside, which is dying from spreading toxic, muddy waste.\n\nHelton, one resident, said his 28-year-old wife and his 35-year-old sister both worked at the facility, owned by Vale, the Brazilian company that is the world's biggest iron-ore miner.\n\nThey are among the 276 missing, presumed dead, likely to swell the list of 84 confirmed fatalities.\n\n\"I asked them to leave. And they said no, because they needed the work,\" said Helton -- who only gave his first name -- adding that rumors of perilous conditions had circulated before the disaster.\n\nMany in and around Brumadinho, the nearest town to the mine, worked for Vale. The community was essentially a company town, tied to what was by far the biggest employer in the area.\n\nThey also live in the shadow of multiple dams that have been used by Vale's operation.\n\n\"They knew it was ging to break. They knew. The boys who worked there were afraid to complain, or they would be fired,\" said Vanderlei Alves, a 52-year-old driver who lost many of his friends.\n\nThe tailings dam, used to store muddy, mineral-laced mining waste, ruptured on Friday, sending 13 million tons of sludge across the mine's administrative and cafeteria buildings, where employees were packed in for lunch, and down into surrounding countryside and the Paraopeba river.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the dead and missing are Vale employees or contractors, buried in up to 15 meters (50 feet) of mud that stretched for 12 kilometers (eight miles) and was at some points up to 300 meters (yards) wide.\n\nGetting at the bodies was painstaking work by Brazilian emergency teams. They had to inch out into the mud and find remains by hand, many of which were then bagged and helicoptered out.\n\n- Vale reacts -\n\nVale's reputation has taken a severe blow, especially as the disaster happened three years after a similar dam break at another of its mines in the same state of Minas Gerais. That earlier rupture killed 19 and caused what was considered the country's worst-ever environmental catastrophe.\n\nVale lost nearly a quarter of its market value on Monday as a result. On Wednesday, its shares clawed back eight percent in Sao Paulo trading after the company announced it was cutting iron ore output and suspending operation of similar tailings dams in Brazil.\n\n\"The market had a positive perception of the main points,\" said Glaucio Legat, of the consulting firm Necton.\n\nCEO Fabio Schvartsman said late Tuesday the dams -- 10 of them, all in Minas Gerais state -- would be decommissioned. He also said iron ore output would be reduced by 10 percent, although Vale said that would be \"partially\" offset by increased production elsewhere.\n\nThe announcement caused the price of iron ore to spike to $87.50 per tonne in the Singapore market, its highest level in nearly two years.\n\nWhile investors were happier, though, Brazilian environmental authorities and local groups depending on the Paraopeba river were far from reassured.\n\n\"I don't want to point the finger at anyone, because accidents happen. But I believe that in this case we need to look for people responsible,\" said Ana Olivia Jardim, a 19-year-old student.\n\n- River pollution -\n\nThere were fears pollution from the mine waste could reach hydro-electric power plants between early and mid-February.\n\nThe environmental group WWF said that a forest area \"equivalent to 125 football fields\" had been lost, and it was still too early to know the full ecological scope of the disaster.\n\nThe toxicity of the muddy waste was not yet known. But communities downstream complained that fish they relied on were floating up, dead.\n\n\"Most of the people around here are rural river dwellers. So we use the Paraopeba river for food, for fishing, for irrigation, and now we can't do any of that,\" said Leda de Oliveria, a 31-year-old elderly care assistant.\n\nHelton said he, too, had heard there was \"a high pollution risk.\"\n\nBut, he said, \"we are not preoccupied with the fish issue right now because we're focused on the search\" for bodies.",

REUTERS/Washington Alves\nVale and BHP have been aiming to restart the mine as early as 2020 following a dam failure in 2015 that killed 19 people and buried a village. A second deadly dam burst at a Vale mine on Friday killed 65 people and there are fears the death toll could soar into the hundreds.\n\nThe Brazilian prosecutor running talks to settle a lawsuit over the Samarco collapse told Reuters on Saturday the second dam burst could scramble those sensitive negotiations.\n\nFederal prosecutor Jose Adercio Sampaio said that depending on Vale’s culpability in the new disaster, it may change how his task force handles a 155 billion reais ($41 billion) case against Samarco. The case is currently suspended amid negotiations for a potential settlement.\n\nA restart at Samarco Mineracao SA depends on talks with prosecutors on building a new tailing dam system and a restructuring of the company’s debt, executives at BHP and Vale have said.\n\nBHP said on Tuesday that Samarco’s operations will only restart if it is safe, economically viable and has the support of the community and regulators.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nIt said Samarco has not yet reached an agreement with its lenders on the restructuring of its unsecured financial obligations.\n\nThe latest dam failing could draw out any settlement for Samarco and potential mine restart, investors said.\n\n“In terms of remediation, it’s clearly a very sensitive time to be trying to resolve it. So now it’s just another thing to try and work through,” said Andy Forster, senior investment officer with Argo Investments in Sydney.\n\nHowever, the fallout for BHP was likely to be limited.\n\n“It’s obviously an ongoing issue - while they do still have minority interest in Samarco, they wear these potential liabilities when they occur,” said Jason Teh, Chief Investment Officer at Vertium Asset Management in Sydney.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n“Samarco is quite small in terms of BHP’s operations. It’s a small proportion of its total business. BHP today has a pretty good balance sheet for any potential liabilities.”\n\nVale fell 24 percent on Monday to lose about 71.34 billion reais ($18.96 billion) in market value.\n\nA rise in iron ore prices after the mine disaster was lifting BHP’s shares as well as fellow Australian iron ore miners Rio Tinto and Fortescue.\n\nBHP shares rose about 2 percent on Tuesday after a long weekend in a broader market down about 0.5 percent.\n\nReporting by Melanie Burton; additional reporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin",

        "input": "Facebook is about to start pushing European users to speed through giving consent for its new GDPR privacy law compliance changes. It will ask people to review how Facebook applies data from the web to target them with ads, and surface the sensitive profile info they share. Facebook will also allow European and Canadian users to turn on facial recognition after six years of the feature being blocked there. But with a design that encourages rapidly hitting the “Agree” button, a lack of granular controls, a laughably cheatable parental consent request for teens and an aesthetic overhaul of Download Your Information that doesn’t make it any easier to switch social networks, Facebook shows it’s still hungry for your data.\n\nThe new privacy change and terms of service consent flow will appear starting this week to European users, though they’ll be able to dismiss it for now — although the May 25th GDPR compliance deadline Facebook vowed to uphold in Europe is looming. Meanwhile, Facebook says it will roll out the changes and consent flow globally over the coming weeks and months with some slight regional differences. And finally, all teens worldwide that share sensitive info will have to go through the weak new parental consent flow.\n\n\n\nFacebook brought a group of reporters to the new Building 23 at its Menlo Park headquarters to preview the changes today. But feedback was heavily critical as journalists grilled Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman. Questions centered around how Facebook makes accepting the updates much easier than reviewing or changing them, but Sherman stuck to talking points about how important it was to give users choice and information.\n\n“Trust is really important and it’s clear that we have a lot of work to do to regain the trust of people on our service” he said, giving us deja vu about Mark Zuckerberg’s testimonies before congress. “We know that people won’t be comfortable using Facebook if they don’t feel that their information is protected.”\n\nTrouble at each step of Facebook’s privacy consent flow\nThere are a ton of small changes, so we’ll lay out each with our criticisms.\n\nFacebook’s consent flow starts well enough with the screen above offering a solid overview of why it’s making changes for GDPR and what you’ll be reviewing. But with just an “X” up top to back out, it’s already training users to speed through by hitting that big blue button at the bottom.\n\n—\n\nSensitive info\nFirst up is control of your sensitive profile information, specifically your sexual preference, religious views and political views. As you’ll see at each step, you can hit the pretty blue “Accept And Continue” button regardless of whether you’ve scrolled through the information. If you hit the ugly grey “Manage Data Setting” button, you have to go through an interstitial where Facebook makes its argument trying to deter you from removing the info before letting you make and save your choice. It feels obviously designed to get users to breeze through it by offering no resistance to continue, but friction if you want to make changes.\n\nFacebook doesn’t let advertisers target you based on this sensitive info, which is good. The only exception is that in the U.S., political views alongside political Pages and Events you interact with impact your overarching personality categories that can be targeted with ads. You can opt out of being targeted by those too. But your only option here is either to remove any info you’ve shared in these categories so friends can’t see it, or allow Facebook to use it to personalize the site. There’s no option to keep this stuff on your profile but not let Facebook use it.\n\n\n\n—\n\nFacial recognition\nFacebook is bringing facial recognition back to Europe and Canada. The Irish Data Protection commissioner who oversees the EU banned it there in 2012. Users in these countries will get a chance to turn it on, which is the default if they speed through. It’s a useful feature that can make sure people know about the photos of them floating around. But here the lack of granularity is concerning. Users might want to see warnings about possible impersonators using their face in their profile pics, but not be suggested as someone to tag in their friends’ photos. Unfortunately, it’s all or nothing. While Facebook is right to make it simple to turn on or off completely, granular controls that unfold for those that want them would be much more empowering.\n\n[Update: This article has been updated to reflect that Facebook indeed can offer facial recognition in Europe and Canada.]\n\n—\n\nData collection across the web\nA major concern that’s arisen in the wake of Zuckerberg’s testimonies is how Facebook uses data collected about you from around the web to target users with ads and optimize its service. While Sherman echoed Zuckerberg in saying that users tell the company they prefer relevant ads, and that this data can help thwart hackers and scrapers, many users are unsettled by the offsite collection practices. Here, Facebook lets you block it from targeting you with ads based on data about your browsing behavior on sites that show its Like and share buttons, conversion Pixel or Audience Network ads. The issue is that there’s no way to stop Facebook from using that data from personalizing your News Feed or optimizing other parts of its service.\n\n\n\n—\n\nNew terms of service\nFacebook recently rewrote its terms of service and data use policy to be more explicit and easy to read. It didn’t make any significant changes other than noting the policy now applies to its subsidiaries like Instagram and Messenger. [Correction: But WhatsApp and Oculus have their own data policies.] That’s all clearly explained here, which is nice.\n\nBut the fact that the button to reject the new Terms of Service isn’t even a button, it’s a tiny “see your options” hyperlink, shows how badly Facebook wants to avoid you closing your account. When Facebook’s product designer for the GDPR flow was asked if she thought this hyperlink was the best way to present the alternative to the big “I Accept” button, she disingenuously said yes, eliciting scoffs from the room of reporters. It seems obvious that Facebook is trying to minimize the visibility of the path to account deletion rather than making it an obvious course of action if you don’t agree to its terms.\n\n\n\nI requested Facebook actually show us what was on the other side of that tiny “see your options” link and this is what we got. First, Facebook doesn’t mention its temporary deactivation option, just the scary permanent delete option. Facebook recommends downloading your data before deleting your account, which you should. But the fact that you’ll have to wait (often a few hours) before you can download your data could push users to delay deletion and perhaps never resume. And only if you keep scrolling do you get to another tiny “I’m ready to delete my account” hyperlink instead of a real button.\n\n\n\n—\n\nParental consent\nGDPR also implements new regulations about how teens are treated, specifically users between the ages of 13 (the minimum age required to sign up for Facebook) and 15. If users in this age range have shared their religious views, political views or sexual preference, Facebook requires them to either remove it or get parental consent to keep it. They also need permission to be targeted with ads based on data from Facebook’s partners. Without that permission, they’ll see a less personalized version of Facebook. But the system for attaining and verifying that parental consent is a joke.\n\nUsers merely select one of their Facebook friends or enter an email address, and that person is asked to give consent for their “child” to share sensitive info. But Facebook blindly trusts that they’ve actually selected their parent or guardian, even though it has a feature for users to designate who their family is, and the kid could put anyone in the email field, including an alternate address they control. Sherman says Facebook is “not seeking to collect additional information” to verify parental consent, so it seems Facebook is happy to let teens easily bypass the checkup.\n\n\n\n—\n\nPrivacy shortcuts\nTo keep all users abreast of their privacy settings, Facebook has redesigned its Privacy Shortcuts in a colorful format that sticks out from the rest of the site. No complaints here.\n\n—\n\nDownload your information\nFacebook has completely redesigned its Download Your Information tool after keeping it basically the same for the past eight years. You can now view your content and data in different categories without downloading it, which alongside the new privacy shortcuts is perhaps the only unequivocally positive and unproblematic change amidst today’s announcements.\n\n\n\nAnd Facebook now lets you select certain categories of data, date ranges, JSON or HTML format and image quality to download. That could make it quicker and easier if you just need a copy of a certain type of content but don’t need to export all your photos and videos, for example. Thankfully, Facebook says you’ll now be able to download your media in a higher resolution than the old tool allowed.\n\nBut the big problem here was the subject of my feature piece this week about Facebook’s lack of data portability. The Download Your Information tool is supposed to let you take your data and go to a different social network. But it only exports your social graph, aka your friends, as a text list of names. There are no links, usernames or other unique identifiers unless friends opt into let you export their email or phone number (only 4 percent of my friends do), so good luck finding the right John Smith on another app. The new version of Download Your Information exports the same old list of names, rather than offering any interoperable format that would let you find your friends elsewhere.\n\n\n\nA higher standard\nOverall, it seems like Facebook is complying with the letter of GDPR law, but with questionable spirit. Sure, privacy is boring to a lot of people. Too little info and they feel confused and scared. Too many choices and screens and they feel overwhelmed and annoyed. Facebook struck the right balance in some places here. But the subtly pushy designs seem intended to steer people away from changing their defaults in ways that could hamper Facebook’s mission and business.\n\nMaking the choices equal in visible weight, rather than burying the ways to make changes in grayed-out buttons and tiny links, would have been more fair. And it would have shown that Facebook has faith in the value it provides, such that users would stick around and leave features enabled if they truly wanted to.\n\nWhen questioned about this, Sherman pointed the finger at other tech companies, saying he thought Facebook was more upfront with users. Asked to clarify if he thought Facebook’s approach was “better,” he said “I think that’s right.” But Facebook isn’t being judged by the industry standard, because it’s not a standard company. It’s built its purpose and its business on top of our private data, and touted itself as a boon to the world. But when asked to clear a higher bar for privacy, Facebook delved into design tricks to keep from losing our data.",

        "input": "Facebook has started to seek explicit consent from users for targeted advertising, storage of sensitive information, and – for the first time in the EU – application of facial recognition technology as the European general data protection regulation (GDPR) is due to come into force in just over a month.\n\nThe company is only required to seek the new permissions in the European Union, but it plans to roll them out to all Facebook users, no matter where they live. The move follows Mark Zuckerberg’s stated goal to apply the spirit of GDPR worldwide.\n\nFacebook logo on screen and mobile device\nFacebook admits tracking users and non-users off-site\nRead more\nWhen Facebook users log in during the coming weeks, they will be asked to agree to the company’s updated terms of service, and to make specific choices in a number of areas defined by the new law.\n\nAdvertisement\nIn a blogpost, Facebook executives Erin Egan and Ashlie Beringer said users would be asked to review information about targeted advertising, and to choose whether or not they want the social network to use data from partners to show them ads; to explicitly confirm whether they’re happy to share “political, religious, and relationship information”, which is defined as specially protected data under EU law; and to agree to the use of facial recognition technology, which Facebook says will be used to detect which pictures users are in and help protect them against strangers using their photos.\n\nSome users, however,say Facebook is attempting to railroad them in to giving consent under the new laws, rather than making it easy to make a meaningful choice.\n\nIf users want to decline the new permissions, they are not able to simply click “no”. Instead, all of the options are presented with a blue button reading “accept and continue” and a white button labelled “manage data settings”. The “manage data settings” button takes them to a second page where Facebook gives more information pushing them into accepting the change, and then a third page where they are able to opt out.\n\n“Overall, it seems like Facebook is complying with the letter of GDPR law, but with questionable spirit,” wrote TechCrunch’s Josh Constine. “The subtly pushy designs seem intended to steer people away from changing their defaults in ways that could hamper Facebook’s mission and business.”\n\nFacial recognition is a particular watershed for Facebook. The company withdrew an earlier facial recognition feature called tag suggestions from the EU and Canada in 2012 over concerns that it was not compatible with data protection laws in those jurisdictions. Now, however, the company believes it can roll out the features worldwide if it secures active consent from users before applying facial recognition technology to their photos.\n\nA California judge allowed a class-action lawsuit against Facebook on Monday over tag suggestions. Users in Illinois are suing the company, arguing that the feature violated state law.",

        "input": "Polls have closed in an Irish referendum on abortion that could represent a change in the path of a country that was once one of Europe’s more socially conservative. \n\nVoters turned out in large numbers on Friday to have their say on whether to repeal the country’s Eighth Amendment, which outlaws abortion by giving equal rights to the unborn.\n\nKEEP READING\nTaliban broke promises on rights: Outgoing Afghan envoy to UN\nTaliban says women can study in gender-segregated universities\n‘Men don’t protect us, they won’t respect us’: Afghan diaries\nBiden administration sues Texas over anti-abortion law\nAn exit poll, conducted for the Irish Times by Ipsos/MRBI, suggested that the country voted by a landslide margin to change the Constitution so that abortion can be legalised.\n\nThe vote to repeal the constitutional ban was predicted to win by 68 percent to 32 percent, according to the poll of 4,000 voters, the Irish Times said.\n\n\nPolls closed at 21:00GMT.\n\nThe first indications of the final result are expected on Saturday, after the count begins at 08:00GMT.\n\nPrime Minister Leo Varadkar, in favour of change, has called the referendum a “once in a generation decision”. \n\nIf the proposal to repeal the Eighth Amendment is defeated on Friday, the country will not have a second referendum and it could be another 35 years before voters have their say on the matter again, Varadkar said, according to the Irish Times. \n\n\nADVERTISING\n\n\nAl Jazeera’s Neave Barker, reporting from the Irish capital, Dublin, said the vote has been contentious.\n\n“The No camp believes they are defending the right of the unborn child, the Yes camp believe they are defending the right of a woman to make often a very difficult decision.”  \n\nCurrently, 78 percent of the Irish population is Catholic, and members of the church are hoping their members will vote “no”.\n\n\nThousands of people living abroad returned home to vote. Ireland is one of the few countries in the European Union that does not allow those abroad to vote via post or in embassies.\n\n\nThose away for less than 18 months remain eligible to vote at their former local polling station. Those living on the Atlantic islands cast their ballot a day early to help prevent delays in transportation and counting the ballot papers. \n\nBelow is what you need to know about the abortion referendum: \n\nEighth Amendment \nFirst voted into the Irish constitution in 1983, the Eighth Amendment recognises the equal right to life of the unborn. \n\nIt says that “the state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.”\n\nIt is commonly viewed to equate the life of a pregnant woman with the foetus, effectively placing a ban on abortion. \n\nWhen voted on, the referendum passed with 66.9 percent voting “yes,” and 33.1 percent voting “no”. About 1.2 million people vote. \nWhy the Eighth Amendment? \nAbortion was illegal in Ireland under the Offences against the Person Act of 1861, but when contraception was legalised in 1974, there was concern from many conservatives that abortions would follow.\n\nA campaign emerged and “pro-life” anti-abortion rights groups lobbied for constitutional protection of the “unborn”. A vote was held on September 7, 1983, which proposed adding an eighth amendment to the Constitution. \nIreland’s then-Attorney General Peter Sutherland warned at the time that the wording “will lead inevitably to confusion and uncertainty, not merely among the medical profession, to whom it has, of course, particular relevance, but also among lawyers and, more specifically, the judges who will have to interpret it.”\n\nWhat does the law say today? \nTwo referendums took place in 1992, allowing women to travel to have an abortion, and another one authorising information about abortion services overseas.\n\nIn 2013, the law was changed to permit abortions when doctor felt a woman’s life might be at risk. But in other cases, a doctor can face prosecution and up to 14 years in jail. \n\nWhy is this vote happening now? \nThere have been a number of high-profile cases that have highlighted what critics say are problems with the current law.\n\nSavita Halappanavar died in hospital in 2012 after being denied an abortion during a miscarriage, and in 2016, Amanda Mellet was forced to travel to England to terminate a pregnancy with a fatal foetal anomaly. \n\nIn 2016, the UN called on Ireland to reverse its strict prohibition, and for the first time, the Irish state compensated a woman for the trauma she suffered from having to go abroad for an abortion. \n\nIn 2017, the Irish government convened a Citizens Assembly to consider evidence on abortion law reform. \n\nThe 99 randomly selected citizens, after hearing extensive evidence, voted in favour (64 percent) of having no restrictions on termination in early pregnancy. The referendum was called earlier this year. \n\nWho is opposed to the referendum? \nAnti-abortion rights groups say they are protecting the foetus through their opposition. Many of these groups are supported from abroad, and they often align themselves with the Catholic Church. \nGeraldine Martin, a spokeswoman for the Love Both anti-abortion rights campaign, said the government had failed to help mothers with unwanted pregnancies. \n\n“At no stage has the government held out its hand to these women and said, ‘How can I help you? How can I take the pressure off you so you don’t feel so driven towards abortion?” she told AFP news agency. \n\nWhat is the main argument to repeal it? \nMany contend that criminalising abortion does not stop it. They argue a “yes” vote allows the government to legislate legal access to healthcare for women legally in Ireland.\n“I’m very hopeful because I believe we have understood in Ireland that it [the ban] is a cruelty that must end now, we’ve had enough,” Ailbhe Smyth, the co-director of the Together for Yes pro-abortion rights campaign, told AFP news agency.
